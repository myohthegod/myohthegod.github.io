<h1 style="text-align:center;font-family: Nunito, sans-serif;">About</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Hello, my name is Edward. Also known as r3ality_cubed, or the creator of MyohTheWeb. Although this website is only a personal project that will receive the occasional update every now and then, anyone, regardless of personality, will have the freedom to access all of this website.<br>This project is designed along with the best interests of the user in mind. Each modification is made with the aim of making the user experience better. Speed, variety, interactive-ness, and graphic design make this website stand out when compared to others.<br>I believe that things like GoGuardian and Securly shouldn't stop people. I like finding ways around obstacles of all sorts, and here I bring you this website, and MyohTheWeb. I am joined in the fight against internet censorship and GoGuardian, Securly, Cisco, and any blocker that exists to make your browsing experience worse.<br>I created MyohTheWeb also as a personal project, and it has now become a pretty huge part of the proxy world. Thank you so much for this support.<br><br>Bye for now! -Edward<br>a.k.a. MyohTheGod or r3ality_cubed</p><br><br>
